## Signal Processing Toolbox (MATLAB & Python)

This repository provides tools for manipulating and analyzing signals using **MATLAB** and **Python**. It is intended for educational and exploration purposes, allowing users to experiment with various signal processing techniques in both popular programming languages.

**Features:**

* **Signal generation:** Create various types of signals (sinusoidal, square, sawtooth, etc.) with customizable parameters.
* **Filtering:** Implement basic filtering techniques (low-pass, high-pass, etc.) using built-in functions and manual calculations.
* **Frequency analysis:** Utilize Fourier transforms (FFT) to analyze the frequency content of signals.
* **Convolution:** Perform convolution operations for signal filtering and analysis.
* **Visualization:** Visualize signals and their frequency spectra using plotting libraries in both languages.

**Dependencies:**

* **MATLAB** with Signal Processing Toolbox
* **Python** with NumPy and SciPy libraries

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (refer to documentation for each language).
3. Open the desired script (`.m` for MATLAB, `.py` for Python) in your respective environment.
4. Edit the script parameters and run it to perform the desired operation.

**Note:**

This repository serves as a starting point for exploring signal processing with MATLAB and Python. Users are encouraged to modify and extend the scripts to create more complex functionalities.

**Contributing:**

Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements, additional techniques, or examples.
